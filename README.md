# Contents of the repository

This repository aggregates comparative trait data for Ungulates and Poaceae that can be applied to 
the study of major trends in human history, shedding light on the social, health, political and 
environmental choices of past societies.

# The goal

Our goal is to present these datasets to the SESHAT database and provide historical, environmental, biological 
and social data to the database. The ungulates and grasses datasets contribute to the study of ancient 
human diets, secondary (food)production and toolmaking and show the crucial role of domesticated and 
wild hooved animals and grasses and cereals. These datasets bring us one step closer to solve 
unanswered questions about human life.

# Organization of data

The data is organized with aid of spreadsheets and separate column descriptions.
-	In the traits data set for poaceae and poales you can read about the total and unique occurences, the definition and the URI's.
- In the traits data set for poales and seedmasses you can read about their ID, type of organism, traits, measurements and units.
- In the data set for raw_means.csv you can read about the sources, definition and units.
- In the traits data set for ungulates you can read about their names, the sources, URI's, definition, units, order, family, genus, species and domestication.
