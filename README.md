# Contents of the repository

This repository aggregates comparative trait data for Ungulates and Poaceae. The repository contains 
data about ungulates and grasses that can be applied in understanding major trends in human history. 
This data is significant in studying how civilizations flourished throughout the past. Studying this 
data sheds light onto the social-, health-, political- and environmental choices of past societies.

# The goal
Our goal is to present these datasets to the SESHAT and provide historical, environmental, biological 
and social data to the database. The ungulates and grasses datasets contribute to the study of ancient 
human diets, secondary (food)production and toolmaking and show the crucial role of domesticated and 
wild hooved animals and grasses and cereals. These datasets bring us one step closer to solve 
unanswered questions about human life.

# Links to the data

- The data is aggregated in this repository:  https://github.com/naturalis/seshat-trait-data-domesticates 
- The data for ungulates came from: https://github.com/naturalis/trait-organismal-ungulates/tree/master/data/CSV
- The data for poaceae came from: https://github.com/naturalis/trait-functional-poaceae/tree/main/data

# These CSV files contain ungulate trait data, trait definitions, and trait sources:

- traits.csv: https://github.com/naturalis/trait-organismal-ungulates/blob/master/data/CSV/ungulatesTraits.csv

# These CSV files contain poaceae seed mass, trait data, trait definitions, and trait sources:

# This CSV file contains a table of environmental variables for many angiosperm species:

- Raw_means.csv: https://github.com/naturalis/seshat-trait-data-domesticates/blob/main/raw_means.csv

# Organization of data

The data is organized with aid of spreadsheets and separate column descriptions.
-	In the traits data set for poaceae and poales you can read about the total and unique occurences, the definition and the URI's.
- In the traits data set for poales and seedmasses you can read about their ID, type of organism, traits, measurements and units.
- In the data set for raw_means.csv you can read about the sources, definition and units.
- In the traits data set for ungulates you can read about their names, the sources, URI's, definition, units, order, family, genus, species and domestication.
