Aspect,https://www.fao.org/soils-portal/soil-survey/soil-maps-and-databases/harmonized-world-soil-database-v12/en/,clockwise in degrees,"The compass direction that a topographic slope faces, usually measured in degrees from north. Aspect can be generated from continuous elevation surfaces."
BulkDensity,http://globalchange.bnu.edu.cn/research/soilw,g/cm3,The soil bulk density (BD) is the mass of soil material divided by the total volume of solids and pores.
AnnualPET,https://envirem.github.io/,millimeters/year,"Annual potential evapotranspiration: a measure of the ability of the atmosphere to remove water through evapotranspiration processes, given unlimited moisture."
AridityIndexThornthwaite,https://envirem.github.io/,-,Thornthwaite aridity index: Index of the degree of water deficit below water need. This measure is strongly influenced by how much water is available.
ClimaticMoistureIndex,https://envirem.github.io/,-,A metric of relative wetness and aridity.
Continentality,https://envirem.github.io/,°C,Average temp. of warmest month - average temp. of coldest month.
EmbergerQ,https://envirem.github.io/,-,Emberger’s pluviothermic quotient: a metric that was designed to differentiate among Mediterranean type climates.
GrowingDegDays0 ,https://envirem.github.io/,-,Sum of mean monthly temperature for months with mean temperature greater than 0℃ multiplied by number of days. 
GrowingDegDays5,https://envirem.github.io/,-,Sum of mean monthly temperature for months with mean temperature greater than 5℃ multiplied by number of days.
MaxTempColdest,https://envirem.github.io/,°C * 10,Maximum temperature of the coldest month.

PETWarmestQuarter,https://envirem.github.io/,mm/month,Mean monthly PET of warmest quarter.
PETWettestQuarter,https://envirem.github.io//,mm/month,Mean monthly PET of wettest quarter.
ThermicityIndex,https://envirem.github.io/,°C ,"Compensated thermicity index: sum of mean annual temp., min. temp. of coldest month, max. temp. of the coldest month, x 10, with compensations for better comparability across the globe."
OrganicCarbon,http://globalchange.bnu.edu.cn/research/soilw,% of weight,The soil organic carbon (SOC) increases the water-holding capacity of soil.
PhCaCL,http://globalchange.bnu.edu.cn/research/soilw,pH measured in CaCI2 solution,"pH, measured in CaCl2 solution. A low pH means an acidic soil."
Slope,https://www.fao.org/soils-portal/soil-survey/soil-maps-and-databases/harmonized-world-soil-database-v12/en/,percent,Slope is the percent change in elevation over a certain distance.
